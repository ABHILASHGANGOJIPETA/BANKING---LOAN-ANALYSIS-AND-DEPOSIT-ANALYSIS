# 🏦 Banking Loan and Deposit Analysis Dashboard

## 📌 Problem Statement
Develop a basic understanding of risk analytics in banking and financial services and understand how data is used to minimise the risk of losing money while lending to customers.

## ✅ Solution
This Power BI dashboard helps banks and financial institutions make data-driven decisions.  
Based on applicants’ profiles, the dashboard provides insights into whether a loan should be approved or not, reducing the risk of defaults.

## 📊 About the Dataset
The dataset contains detailed banking and client information across multiple interlinked tables.  
The key tables include:
- **Banking Relationship**
- **Client-Banking**
- **Gender**

These tables are connected using **primary keys** and **foreign keys**.

## 🛠️ Data Cleaning

- Ensured consistency in client and banking details for accurate reporting.
- Established relationships between tables for smooth data modeling in Power BI.
